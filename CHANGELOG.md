2020/11/29 v0.1.0
 - stable, but still has crashes. Use the bat to start the app.js, when it crashes it restarts
 + simple nodejs http server added to the project instead of using external http hosting software (Xampp) like previously suggested - honestly I don't know why I didn't do this to start with.
  + default "/" route -> "index.html" = betfair json demo, list of URLs with ~accepted odds
 + vars and comments to change server conf and odds parameters in the app.js file
 + "useful links" table added to the demo page, making it easier to go to the calculator
 + better information displayed on the console (odds and server port)
 
2020/11/27 v0.0.1
 + just trash up until this point
